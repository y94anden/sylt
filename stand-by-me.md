[Intro]

[Verse 1]  
When the night has come  
And the land is dark  
And the moon is the only light we'll see  
No, I won't be afraid  
Oh, I won't be afraid  
Just as long as you stand, stand by me  

[Chorus]  
So darlin', darlin', stand by me  
Oh, stand by me  
Oh, stand  
Stand by me, stand by me  

[Verse 2]  
If the sky that we look upon  
Should tumble and fall  
Or the mountains should crumble to the sea  
I won't cry, I won't cry  
No, I won't shed a tear  
Just as long as you stand, stand by me  

[Chorus]  
And darlin', darlin', stand by me  
Oh, stand by me  
Woah, stand now  
Stand by me, stand by me  

[Interlude]

[Chorus]  
Darlin', darlin', stand by me  
Oh, stand by me  
Oh, stand now  
Stand by me, stand by me  

Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me  
Oh, stand by me  
Woah, just stand now  
Oh, stand, stand by me
